## What This Script Does
This script automates the following actions on your system:
1. **Installs Required Packages**:
   - Updates the package list using `apt update`.
   - Installs `squid` (proxy server software) and `apache2-utils` (for managing user authentication).
2. **Creates a Password File**:
   - Generates an authentication file at `/etc/squid/passwd`.
   - Sets appropriate permissions (`chmod 777`) for managing the file.
   - Uses `htpasswd` to create a username and password for proxy access.
3. **Backs Up the Existing Squid Configuration**:
   - Saves the original Squid configuration file as `/etc/squid/squid.conf.bak`.
4. **Creates a New Squid Configuration**:
   - Configures the proxy server to:
     - Use basic authentication for access.
     - Allow traffic only on safe ports (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
     - Disable caching and logging for privacy.
     - Use the user-defined port for proxy connections.
5. **Restarts the Squid Service**:
   - Applies the new configuration by restarting the Squid service.
6. **Displays Configuration Details**:
   - Outputs the server's public IP address, proxy port, username, and password for user reference.
